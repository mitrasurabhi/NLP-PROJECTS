# NLP-PROJECTS
The objective of this project is to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning algorithms to develop an application capable of classifying whether question pairs on Quora are duplicate or not. This classification process is essential in providing Quora users with high-quality answers and an enhanced experience as both question writers and seekers.
The primary goal is to build a model that can identify semantically similar questions, i.e., questions that share similar meanings. By deploying this model on question-answer based platforms, we can effectively determine whether a query with a similar meaning has already been answered or not. This functionality helps in avoiding redundant answers and improves the efficiency of information retrieval.
To achieve this, various algorithms will be tested, including logistic regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaBoost Classifier, as well as Deep Neural Networks like CNN and LSTM. These algorithms will be evaluated based on their accuracy, which serves as the main parameter for comparison.
